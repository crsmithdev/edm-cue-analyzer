    "# Wolfram Notebook Analysis: Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "The Wolfram notebook by Suhaan Mobhani demonstrates a drop detection approach for EDM tracks based on **Short-Time Energy (STE)** analysis. Here are the key insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Short-Time Energy Calculation\n",
    "- **Primary Feature**: The notebook uses Short-Time Energy as the main signal for drop detection\n",
    "- **Formula**: Energy = Map(Total(Abs(#)^2), SpectrogramArray data)\n",
    "- This is similar to our HPSS energy calculation but applied directly to spectrogram data\n",
    "- **Key Quote**: \"The drops, which are points where the track has built up to its highest energy, which then rapidly falls\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Energy Profile Characteristics\n",
    "- **Drops are loudest**: \"drops are typically the loudest and most unique song of the music\"\n",
    "- **Rapid energy change**: \"where the track has built up to its highest energy, which then rapidly falls\"\n",
    "- **Build-up preceding**: \"most of them following a buildup\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Implementation Details\n",
    "- **Window size**: Uses SpectrogramArray with parameter 131072 for full-track analysis\n",
    "- For detailed analysis around drops, increases resolution to 65536 samples\n",
    "- **Time scaling**: Adjusts axis range to match track duration in seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Drop Region Analysis (Novel Approach)\n",
    "- **5-second radius**: Analyzes 5 seconds before and after each drop\n",
    "- **Uniform duration**: Pads tracks to ensure all drop intervals have exactly 10 seconds\n",
    "- **Comparative analysis**: Plots energy of all drop intervals together to identify patterns\n",
    "\n",

    "## Differences from Our Current Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current (Onset-Based):\n",
    "1. Uses `onset_strength` from Essentia's complex onset detection\n",
    "2. Looks for **peaks** in onset signal (sudden increases)\n",
    "3. Statistical thresholds: mean + 1.2 * std\n",
    "4. Validates with energy contrast (1.6x bass, 1.5x percussion)\n",
    "5. Sustained breakdown requirement (>50% low energy over 8 bars)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wolfram (Energy-Based):\n",
    "1. Uses Short-Time Energy from spectrogram\n",
    "2. Looks for **energy buildup → peak → rapid fall** pattern\n",
    "3. No explicit peak detection algorithm shown in the notebook\n",
    "4. Focus on \"loudest\" points followed by rapid decrease\n",
    "5. Post-detection: analyzes similarity across all drops\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applicable Techniques for Our Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Change 7: Energy Derivative Analysis ✅\n",
    "**What**: Calculate rate of change in energy signal to find rapid decreases\n",
    "**Why**: Drops are characterized by \"rapidly falls\" after peak\n",
    "**How**: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "low_derivative = np.gradient(low_energy)\n",
    "perc_derivative = np.gradient(percussive_energy)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Look for negative derivatives after onset peaks to confirm drop pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "### Change 8: Build-Up Detection\n",
    "**What**: Detect increasing energy trend before drops\n",
    "**Why**: \"most of them following a buildup\"\n",
    "**How**: \n",
    "- Look for sustained energy increase in preceding 8-16 bars\n",
    "- Could use linear regression or moving average slope\n",
    "- Add as validation criterion alongside current checks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Change 9: Drop Pattern Matching\n",
    "**What**: Compare energy profiles of detected drops for consistency\n",
    "**Why**: \"analyze the regions around all the drops to see if they have a similar composition\"\n",
    "**How**:\n",
    "- Extract 5-second windows around each drop\n",
    "- Calculate similarity (correlation, DTW distance)\n",
    "- Filter out outliers that don't match typical drop profile\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommended Implementation Order\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Change 7**: Energy derivatives (easiest to implement, direct from paper)\n",
    "2. **Change 8**: Build-up detection (moderate complexity, clear benefit)\n",
    "3. **Change 9**: Pattern matching (more complex, secondary validation)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Change 7**: Should reduce false positives by confirming energy drop\n",
    "- **Change 8**: Should increase precision by requiring proper build-up\n",
    "- **Change 9**: Should improve consistency across track\n",
    "\n",
    "Current metrics: F1=42%, P=45%, R=38%\n",
    "Target: F1>55%, P>60%, R>50%"

    "## Key Techniques from Wolfram Notebook (Based on Outline)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wolfram notebook uses these techniques for EDM drop detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Short-Time Energy (STE) Analysis**\n",
    "- Calculate energy in overlapping windows across the track\n",
    "- This is the PRIMARY feature for drop detection (vs. our onset-based approach)\n",
    "- Formula: `STE(n) = Σ(x[i]^2)` for samples in window n\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Peak Detection on Energy Signal**\n",
    "- Look for **sudden increases followed by rapid decreases** in STE\n",
    "- This is characteristic of drops: build-up → explosion → sustained\n",
    "- Different from our approach which focuses on onset strength\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Drop Region Extraction**\n",
    "- Extract build-up section BEFORE the drop\n",
    "- Extract the drop itself\n",
    "- Analyze them as connected segments\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Similarity Analysis Between Drops**\n",
    "- Cross-correlation between drop regions\n",
    "- Spectral similarity metrics\n",
    "- Energy pattern matching\n",
    "- This could help identify \"real\" drops vs. mini-drops by comparing to known drop templates\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Spectrogram Analysis**\n",
    "- Visual/computational analysis of time-frequency representation\n",
    "- Likely looking for characteristic spectral patterns of drops\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Differences from Our Current Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our approach:**\n",
    "- Onset detection (complex method) → find peaks\n",
    "- Energy/bass/percussion validation\n",
    "- Statistical thresholds (mean + N*std)\n",
    "- Sustained breakdown requirement (8 bars of low energy)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wolfram approach:**\n",
    "- **Direct STE analysis** (simpler, more focused)\n",
    "- **Pattern matching**: increase → decrease in energy\n",
    "- **Derivative analysis**: looking at rate of change\n",
    "- **Similarity-based validation**: compare drops to each other\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential Improvements to Try\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add STE-based detection** alongside onset detection\n",
    "2. **Use derivative/rate-of-change** of energy signal\n",
    "3. **Pattern matching**: look for characteristic build-up → drop energy profile\n",
    "4. **Template matching**: compare detected drops to known good examples\n",
    "5. **Better build-up detection**: analyze the section BEFORE the drop"

    "\n",
    "Let's implement the most promising techniques from the Wolfram approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Change 7: Add Energy Derivative Analysis**\n",
    "Look for rapid increases in energy (steep positive slope) followed by sustained high energy.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Change 8: Improve Build-up Detection** \n",
    "Currently we look backward 12 seconds for low energy. Instead:\n",
    "- Look for **increasing** energy trend in the 4-8 bars before the drop\n",
    "- This distinguishes real build-ups from random loud moments\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Change 9: Add Short-Time Energy (STE) Feature**\n",
    "Complement onset detection with direct STE calculation.\n",
    "Some drops might have strong energy but weak onsets (smooth builds).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with Change 7 (derivative analysis) since it's most directly applicable."

    "# Implementation Complete: Change 7\n",
    "\n",
    "## Energy Derivative Analysis (Wolfram Technique)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** in `src/edm_cue_analyzer/analyses/drops.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Was Added\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Energy Derivatives Calculation** (after line 87):\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Calculate energy derivatives (Change 7: Wolfram technique)\n",
    "   # Drops are characterized by \"rapidly falls\" after peak\n",
    "   low_derivative = np.gradient(low_energy)\n",
    "   perc_derivative = np.gradient(percussive_energy)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rapid Fall Validation** (lines 177-188):\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Change 7: Verify energy \"rapidly falls\" after peak (Wolfram technique)\n",
    "   # True drops should show declining energy in the bars following the onset\n",
    "   lookforward_frames = int((4 * bar_duration) / energy_window_seconds)\n",
    "   lookforward_end = min(len(low_derivative), idx + lookforward_frames)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   if lookforward_end > idx:\n",
    "       post_drop_low = low_derivative[idx:lookforward_end]\n",
    "       post_drop_perc = perc_derivative[idx:lookforward_end]\n",
    "       \n",
    "       # Require >60% of following frames to show negative derivative (falling energy)\n",
    "       rapid_fall = (np.sum(post_drop_low < 0) / len(post_drop_low) > 0.6 and\n",
    "                    np.sum(post_drop_perc < 0) / len(post_drop_perc) > 0.6)\n",
    "       \n",
    "       if not rapid_fall:\n",
    "           continue  # Skip - energy doesn't fall after peak (likely false positive)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- After detecting a strong onset peak, we now verify that the energy **actually drops** in the following 4 bars\n",
    "- Uses NumPy's `gradient()` to calculate rate of energy change\n",
    "- Checks that at least 60% of frames show negative derivatives (decreasing energy)\n",
    "- This filters out false positives where onset peaks don't lead to actual drops\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Target**: Reduce false positives from 6 to ~3\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Validates the Wolfram paper's core insight - drops \"rapidly fall\" after peak\n",
    "- **Precision boost**: Should improve from 45% → 60%+\n",
    "- **F1 improvement**: From 42% → 55%+\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps for Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "To validate this change, run the analyzer on test tracks:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m edm_cue_analyzer path/to/track.mp3 --debug\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Look for debug messages showing:\n",
    "- Candidates filtered out due to no rapid fall\n",
    "- Remaining drops that pass all validation checks"
